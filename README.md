1. The simplicity of the website, the fact that it is minimalistic and I've tried to make it less crowded should enable the user to navigate with ease. 
2. The user is quickly able to view the courses by pressing the courses tab on the top right hand corner which will lead them to a new page and display the courses.
3. A short description on the homepage as to why they should choose us should make them feel confident in using our services. 
4. Having a testimonial on the homepage towards the bottom allows the students to read and see what other students have said about the language centre. 
5. The user can book their course via the book button on the hero image or navigate to the booking page by clicking sign up on the top right. They can also view the courses tab which will bring up all the courses. They can make an inquiry by completing the contact form on the sign up page.
6. The user can immeadiately navigate to the booking page via the book button on the hero image.

Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

**Bugs discovered**

I couldn't upload a hero image succesfully - the image was to big and wouldn't fit on the page. I tried changing the code, height, width, position etc, nothing would work. I then did some research and found out from the image properties that the pixels were to large and I had to compress the image. I found pixabay useful for this because it enables you to enter the image size. I uploaded the image, entered a height and width and it seemed to work. I still don't feel confident uploading pictures but with practice i should get better.  

Still having trouble with pictures - testimnial section was an issue sorting out (see footer bug image)

When creating a link for the find your course button the text was highlighted blue - found out that i already had a class named active so i had to rename the class add to css and style.
