# The Language Hub 
--------------------------


## Introduction 

Welcome to my first project. This is a website for people of all ages looking to learn English online or face-to-face.  

The primary goal of the website is for me to have an online presence and for students to view the available courses and get in touch.  

You can view the deployed website [here]( https://sirajrafique.github.io/The-Language-Hub/)

**1. UX**
---------

I received inspiration for this project from the mini project Love Running and my current part-time work as an English Language teacher. 

The website has been kept simple to allow the user to navigate with ease and to quickly find and view the available courses and sign up page. 
            
**1.1 Client Stories:** 

1. As a visitor to the site, I want to be able to navigate with ease.
2. As a visitor, I want to be able to view the courses available. 
3. As a visitor, I want to be able to feel confident I'm in the right hands when it comes to learning English.
4. As a potential student, I want to know what other students think of the school and teaching. 
5. As a potential student, I want to be able to book a course, view times and or make an enquiry. 
6. As an Interested student, I want to be able to Immeadiately book a course. 
7. As an Interested student, I want to be able to complete a contact form. 
8. As an Interested student, I want to be able to follow the school on social media. 

**1.2 Mock up:**

Wireframes created as part of the design process - View [here](https://github.com/SirajRafique/The-Language-Hub/blob/9449484987aeda6649d5cb29102aebc8848ad003/Wireframes.md)


**2. Features**
------------

**All Web Pages:**

- Every page has a logo on the top left, telling the user what website they are viewing. They can click on the logo on any page and it will revert them back to the homepage. On the top right, the pages have a nav bar with the following Home/Courses/Sign-Up and they all have a hover effect improving the users experience. When somoene moves their mouse over Home, Courses or Menu, the mouse turns into a pointer and it will underline the option in blue, highlighting what page they are about to enter. The nav link also remains underlined notifying the user what page they are currently on.

- All four social media links, YouTube, FaceBook, Twitter and Instagram have been placed at the bottom of the pages inside a footer. The individual icons once clicked, open up into a new tab; supporting user behaviour through usability. 

**Home Page:**

- A hero image of a teacher with cover text that zooms out. It's a connotative image to present to the user that they are on a Educational website. The text instantly tells the user why the Language Hub. 

- Below the hero image is some text, a short summary telling the user why they should study with us; in a bullet pointed format. A simple and straight to the point list with a useful hover button feature that leads them to the sign up page. To the right is an image of students on their laptops, smiling and happy - with the intention to make the user feel comfortable and to let them know that we are a friendly language institute. 

- A testimonial section for users to read what other students have said about us. To avoid having just text and to improve user experience a picture of a person has been added.

**Courses Page:**

-  A list of courses on a flip card feature to provide good interface aesthetics and enhance usability. The choice of colors represent the brand and were chosen for better visual experience for the user. When the user hovers over the course, the card flips giving the user more information about that course, the prices, dates and what to do next. 
This feature was chosen to make it easier for users to view the courses on smaller devices all the while still being aesthetically pleasing.  

**Sign Up Page**

- A picture of a woman on a laptop signing up for a course for better visual experince. A user friendly booking form alongside the picture for users to easily book or enquire about a course. The single column layout makes it easier for the user to complete the form and the questions are in a logical and intuitive order.

**5. Bugs discovered**
--------------------------------

[*GO TO THE TOP*](#UX) <a name="UX"></a>

I couldn't upload a hero image succesfully - the image was to big and wouldn't fit on the page. I tried changing the code, height, width, position etc, nothing would work. I then did some research and found out from the image properties that the pixels were to large and I had to compress the image. I found pixabay useful for this because it enables you to enter the image size. I uploaded the image, entered a height and width and it seemed to work. I still don't feel confident uploading pictures but with practice i should get better.  

Still having trouble with pictures. The Hero Image is static and not absolute - there is an issue with the responsiveness. I can't get the image to shrink when using a smaller screen. 

Below is another issue which I fixed by resizing the image. 

![footer bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80712910/119226967-a277fa80-bb03-11eb-82e1-cbcfc56b374a.PNG)

When creating a link for the find your course button the text was highlighted blue - found out that I already had a class named active so I had to rename the class and then add to css and style.
