# The Language Hub 
--------------------------

Click [Here]( https://sirajrafique.github.io/The-Language-Hub/) to view deployed website. 

This is a website for people of all ages looking to learn English online or face-to-face.  
They can have their English tested and or book one of our courses with a British Council accredited teacher. 
The website has been kept simple with the available courses outlined on the courses pages. 
The primary goal of the website is to have an online presence for students that I already teach face to face and to gain further business via word of mouth/recommendation. Anyone visiting will quickly be able to choose a course, book and make contact.

### Features
------------

All pages have a responsive navigation bar top right and a logo top left. All pages also have a footer with social media icons linking to the social media pages. 



1. The simplicity of the website, the fact that it is minimalistic and I've tried to make it less crowded should enable the user to navigate with ease. 
2. The user is quickly able to view the courses by pressing the courses tab on the top right hand corner which will lead them to a new page and display the courses.
3. A short description on the homepage as to why they should choose us should make them feel confident in using our services. 
4. Having a testimonial on the homepage towards the bottom allows the students to read and see what other students have said about the language centre. 
5. The user can book their course via the book button on the hero image or navigate to the booking page by clicking sign up on the top right. They can also view the courses tab which will bring up all the courses. They can make an inquiry by completing the contact form on the sign up page.
6. The user can immeadiately navigate to the booking page via the book button on the hero image.  
7. Contact form is available on the sign up page.
8. There are social media links on each page at the bottom which the user can click on.

Including client stories testing. 

All navigation links checked and they work.  


**Bugs discovered**

I couldn't upload a hero image succesfully - the image was to big and wouldn't fit on the page. I tried changing the code, height, width, position etc, nothing would work. I then did some research and found out from the image properties that the pixels were to large and I had to compress the image. I found pixabay useful for this because it enables you to enter the image size. I uploaded the image, entered a height and width and it seemed to work. I still don't feel confident uploading pictures but with practice i should get better.  

Still having trouble with pictures. The Hero Image is static and not absolute - there is an issue with the responsiveness. I can't get the image to shrink when using a smaller screen. 

Below is another issue which I fixed by resizing the image. 

![footer bug](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/80712910/119226967-a277fa80-bb03-11eb-82e1-cbcfc56b374a.PNG)

When creating a link for the find your course button the text was highlighted blue - found out that I already had a class named active so I had to rename the class and then add to css and style.
